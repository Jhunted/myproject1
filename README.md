Basics
Here's what you need to know to play War.


Players: 2
Deck: Standard 52-card deck
Goal: To win all of the cards
Setup
Shuffle the deck and deal the cards so that each player gets 26 cards. Players keep their cards in front of them, face down.

Gameplay
Each player simultaneously turns over their top card. The higher card wins the pair; the winning player takes both cards and puts them at the bottom of their face-down pile. (Ace is high card; 2 is low card.)

In the event of a tie, the players have a "war." Each player places three cards face down in the middle of the table and then turns a fourth card face up. The player with the higher of these cards takes all 10 cards which are now in the middle. If these two cards are also a tie, additional cards are turned face up, one at a time, until one player wins; that player takes the entire set of cards.

Winning
The first player to win the entire deck of cards is the winner. Alternatively, because winning the entire deck can take a long time, the first player to win three wars is the winner.
